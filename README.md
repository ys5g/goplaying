# GoPlaying

## Description

This is a basic Now Playing TUI written in Go. I wanted a simple way to see what was playing on my Spotify account without having to open the app. This is a simple solution that uses playerctl to get the currently playing song and display it in the terminal. It even gives you basic controls to play/pause, skip, and go back.
